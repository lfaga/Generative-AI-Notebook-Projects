# Generative-AI-Notebook-Projects
A collection of my project work in generative AI using Python, PyTorch, and various ML frameworks.

Projects:

1. Configurable SD1.5 Image Generation Pipeline

    Description: An end-to-end, configuration-driven pipeline for generating images with Stable Diffusion 1.5. It programmatically orchestrates ComfyUI components, handles different model architectures, and dynamically applies LoRAs.

    Skills Demonstrated: Configuration-Driven Design, Pipeline Orchestration, ComfyUI, Python.

2. Resource-Constrained Video Generation (WAN 2.1)

    Description: A proof-of-concept pipeline that successfully generates short videos from an image using the WAN 2.1 model on a resource-limited Google Colab T4 GPU.

    Skills Demonstrated: Aggressive VRAM management, multi-stage model loading/unloading, stateful pipeline execution, PyTorch, ComfyUI. This project is a case study in optimizing memory-intensive ML workflows under extreme hardware constraints.

4. SDXL Image Generation with Hugging Face Diffusers

    Description: A streamlined notebook for generating high-resolution images with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) using the high-level diffusers library from Hugging Face.

    Skills Demonstrated: Adaptability, Hugging Face Ecosystem, SDXL, Python.
